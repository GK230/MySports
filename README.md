Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

This is a website about one of my hobbies/interests, which is sports/fitness activities.

The website is responsive: the navigation and titles of pages have been adjusted using Bootstrap media queries breakpoints.

*index.html*
This is the homepage of my website and is designed as a business card. I have designed and made other websites about my other interests using this same format and I thought it would be a good idea to keep using the same theme. The page uses the Bootstrap card component.

*styles.css*
This is the styling for the homepage. I have used a Google font which simulates my handwriting for the main title. It is the only place this font is used in the website, so that it looks uniqued. I have used the same font for my other websites describing my interests. I have used another Google font for the navigation bar, different from my other websites about my interests, so that this website looks a little different from the others.

*profile.html*
This is a little about me. Actually it is a list of the dreams/inspiration I have had while doing the various activities I have done.

*profile.css*
This is the styling for the profile page. It is fairly simple, just a paragraph about me, as you would find in a book, for example. I have used another Google font for the paragraph, which I use throughout the website, providing a uniform look.

*activities.html*
This is a list of all the sports/fitness activities I have done in the form of various silhouettes. I do not have any photos of me doing the various activities and I did not want to use photos of other people, as this would be misleading. I was first going to use a variety of photos of the clubs I have been involved in and clipart, but then I across many silhouettes of the various activities I have done, and I felt this gave the website a more uniform, nicer look. I have chosen silhouettes of women who resemble me.

*activities.css*
This is the styling for the activities page. I have adjusted the various silhouettes so that they all a similar size - they were various sizes when I downloaded them. On the smallest screen size they are on top of each other, as I felt they looked quite small on small screens.

*experience.html*
This page describes my experience of the various activities I have done. It is mostly just my personal feelings and experiences. The page uses the Bootstrap grid model. 

*experience.scss*
This is the styling for the experience page. It uses sass, which was useful as most of the html tags are nested in the Bootstrap grid model. The styling for the text is slightly different - it is made to look like typewriter text - I thought that this would look good, as this page contains my personal thoughts and feelings.

*history.html*
This page is a chronological history of the details of all the activities I have done throughout my life. It is in a table format. The table for small screens has been adjusted with Bootstrap responsive table tags.

*history.css*
This is the styling for the history page. I have not added borders as I felt this looked better, and simply added emphasis and underlining to the main headings in the table.

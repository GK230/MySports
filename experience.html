                <div class="col-4"><a id="title-gymnastics"><h5>Gymnastics</h5></a>
                    <p>
                        The first sporting/fitness activity that I did. My first love and therefore
                        special. I still cannot find another activity that matches it. I simply love 
                        the feeling of flying through the air - I feel so good afterwards, better than 
                        after any other workout.

                <div class="col-4"><a id="title-taekwondo"><h5>Tae Kwon Do</h5></a>
                    <p>
                        I always wanted to do martial arts: in order to defend myself, keep
                        fit and have fun! Tae Kwon Do seemed the natural first choice as the kicks
                        which are an important part seemed fun to do for a gymnast and I was right -
                        the kicks just make me feel so good.

                <div class="col-4"><a id="title-yoga"><h5>Yoga</h5></a>
                    <p>
                        I have actually been doing yoga since I was a child, encouraged by my 
                        mother. I have done various types of yoga such as: Hatha yoga; which is
                        purely physical; Fitness yoga, which all about keeping fit; Kundalini
                        yoga, which concentrates on meditation and breathing.

                    <p>
                        I have done various types of fitness training, including: aerobics, body pump,
                        gym circuits and I have also had a personal trainer. These things are important
                        for keeping fit so I can do other activities.

                <div class="col-4"><a id="title-kungfu"><h5>Kung fu</h5></a>
                    <p>
                        I was attracted to Kung fu due to the way it seemed so balletic in films.
                        I have done elements of ballet in my gymnastics training, and also done other
                        forms of dance, therefore I thought I would really enjoy Kung fu. I was right - the 
                        dance training really helped and so Kung fu was something I thoroughly enjoyed.

                <div class="col-4"><a id="title-walking"><h5>Walking</h5></a>
                    <p>
                        I love the mindfulness aspect of walking. I have walked alone and also with 
                        others in groups and both are something I enjoy equally. It's good to breathe
                        in fresh air and be outdoors - something which connects me back to nature and
                        makes me feel good.

                <div class="col-4"><a id="title-barre"><h5>Barre</h5></a>
                    <p>
                        I thought I would enjoy Barre for the same reason I thought I would enjoy Kung fu - 
                        my experience with ballet. I have done some actual ballet classes, but I knew Barre
                        would be different - it focuses more on fitness. And I was right again, I love Barre.
                        It is the toughest fitness class I have ever done, but with the most feel good after
                        factor.

                <div class="col-4"><a id="title-running"><h5>Running</h5></a>
                    <p>
                        I loved running as part of the other activities I did and I wanted to something
                        more challenging than walking, so running seemed the obvious choice. It was hard at first,
                        but as I improved I began to enjoy it very much.
